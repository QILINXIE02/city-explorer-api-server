# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

4/5 Cache feature lab 10# Project Name: Weather Application

**Author**: Qilin Xie
**Version**: 1.5.0 

## Overview
This project involves building a weather application that allows users to search for weather forecasts by city name. The application consists of a frontend written in React, where users can input a city name, and a backend server that fetches weather data from external APIs.

## Getting Started
I set up both the frontend and backend components. Begin by constructing the backend system to fetch required data from relevant APIs. Then, create a frontend interface for user interaction where users can input a city name to view the weather forecast.

## Architecture
The application is built with Axios, Cors, and Express.

## Change Log
### Frontend:
- [4/5 3pm] Implemented caching feature to improve performance.

### Backend:
- [4/5 3pm] Integrated caching mechanism for efficient data retrieval.

## Credit and Collaborations
Thanks to ChatGPT for assistance.

## Time Estimates
1. **Cache Feature Implementation**
   - **Estimate**: 1 hour
   - **Start Time**: 1:00 PM
   - **Finish Time**: 2:00 PM
   - **Actual Time**: 1 hour

2. **Integrating Yelp API**
   - **Estimate**: 30 minutes
   - **Start Time**: 2:30 PM
   - **Finish Time**: 3:05 PM
   - **Actual Time**: 35 minutes
